# Crossfire — adversarial + empirical verification (Phase 1 core)

You are the **orchestrator**. When `/crossfire` is invoked you run ONE verification
pass over a target (code files or a plan doc): spawn parallel adversarial lens
sub-agents + a synchronous Codex review + the project's own tests/lint (health),
then consolidate, gate, and report (or apply) fixes. You are the single durable
memory of this run — sub-agents are stateless workers you coordinate.

**Do not trust lens/Codex output on faith.** They can be over-strict, wrong, or
hallucinate. YOU adjudicate every finding (Step 4.5) — verifying it yourself,
empirically where possible — before anything reaches the user or the gate.

**Default is a single pass (`cycles=1`).** If `cycles=` is greater than 1, run the
**carry-over convergence loop** in `references/cycles.md`: Steps 2–5 below become one cycle,
and you carry a findings ledger between cycles (injecting a brief into each next-cycle worker)
with an acknowledgment contract. Recommend `cycles ≤ 5`.

References (read the relevant one before the step that needs it):
- `references/lenses.md` — lens catalog, signal→lens table, priority, prompt templates, the worker return schema (+ Phase-2 `acks`).
- `references/tools.md` — canonical tool registry (commands, prereqs, timeouts, cost).
- `references/cycles.md` — **Phase 2** loop: ledger, carry-over brief, acknowledgment contract, convergence, checkpoint, `resume`.
- `references/adjudicate.md` — **Step 4.5**: how YOU verify each finding so lens false-positives never reach the user.

## Step 0 — Parse args + preflight + budget

Parse args (all optional):
- `path=` — file / dir / glob to verify. May also be given as the first bare argument.
- `mode=auto|code|plan` (default `auto`).
- `fix=report|apply` (default `report`). Plan docs are **always report-only unless the user explicitly confirms** edits.
- `lenses=auto|N|csv` (default `auto`).
- `tools=` — additive opt-ins (`+security,+stats,+perf,+visual`) or `none` (lenses only). Default base = `codex,health`.
- `url=` — only when `+perf`/`+visual` opted in.
- `cycles=N` (default 1). N>1 → carry-over convergence loop (`references/cycles.md`).
- `resume=<run>` — continue a prior run's ledger (`references/cycles.md`).
- `--full-audit` — persist unmasked worker prompts (default masks secrets).
- `--refute` — extra rigor: spawn skeptic sub-agents to try to refute each confirmed P1 (off by default; see `references/adjudicate.md`).

Preflight (run via Bash, read-only):
```bash
WORK_ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "${TARGET:-.}")" 2>/dev/null && pwd || pwd)"
RUN_ID="$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)-$$"
RUN_DIR="$HOME/.crossfire/runs/$RUN_ID"
mkdir -p "$RUN_DIR/baseline"
command -v codex >/dev/null && echo "codex: ok" || echo "codex: MISSING (skip + note)"
# REPO_ROOT only if inside a git work tree:
git -C "$WORK_ROOT" rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null && echo "git: yes" || echo "git: no (non-git mode)"
```
Detect health tools from stack files (see `references/tools.md`). Any missing tool →
**skip that layer and note it in the report** (never silently fall back).

**Disclose the budget BEFORE running** (print to the user): the selected lenses + the
signal that triggered each, dropped candidates, the tool set, and a rough max wall-time.

## Step 1 — Resolve target (non-git friendly)

- If `path=` is given, that file/glob is the **verification subject**. `mode=code` unless the path is a `.md` plan (then `plan`), or honor explicit `mode=`.
- If `path=` omitted, auto-detect: ① `git diff` (staged→unstaged) present → code mode, capture diff + base; ② else a plan doc (active plan-mode file or `~/.claude/plans/*.md`; if several, newest or ask) → plan mode; ③ ambiguous/none → ask once with `AskUserQuestion`, or stop if nothing to verify.
- **Snapshot (non-git change tracking):** copy the target files into `$RUN_DIR/baseline/`. If no prior snapshot exists to diff against, treat the **whole specified file(s)** as the subject and say so in the report.

## Step 2 — Auto-select lenses (read `references/lenses.md`)

Mandatory lenses always run: **correctness/logic** and **edge-cases/failure-modes**
(plan mode: **feasibility/consistency** and **missing-cases**). Add signal-triggered
lenses (security, performance, concurrency, data-validity/stats, simplicity, API-contract)
per the detector table. **Clamp to 2–6**; when the cap binds, keep by priority
(security > data-validity > concurrency > performance > API > simplicity); **security and
data-validity are never dropped once triggered**. `lenses=N` keeps the top-N by priority
but is clamped to include the mandatory + non-droppable triggered lenses (reject impossible N).
`lenses=csv` adds/removes optional lenses only — mandatory lenses are force-added if missing.

## Step 3 — Run the panel (parallel)

Launch concurrently (one message, multiple tool calls):
- **Lens sub-agents** — one `Agent` (subagent_type `Explore`, read-only) per selected lens.
  Give each the lens prompt from `references/lenses.md` + the subject (diff or file contents)
  + the instruction to return findings in the **worker return schema** (strict JSON block).
  Adversarial framing: "find flaws, no praise, try to break it."
- **Codex (reviewer), synchronous foreground** — see `references/tools.md` for the exact command.
  Git: `codex review --base <base> ...`. Non-git/explicit files:
  `codex exec "<scoped guard> Adversarially review these files: <paths>. Tag findings [P1]/[P2]/[P3]." -C "$WORK_ROOT" -s read-only -c 'model_reasoning_effort="high"'`.
  **scoped safety guard** (prepend): "Only read the named target file(s). Do NOT read other files under ~/.claude/** (config/secrets)."
  Codex CLI is synchronous and NOT subject to the `ask` async guardrail — it completes in-turn.
  (Crossfire's synchronous Codex satisfies the CLAUDE.md reviewer checkpoint for this run.)
- **health** — detect & run the project's tests/typecheck/lint directly (see `references/tools.md`).
  **Baseline first:** record pre-existing failures separately; only **new / target-related** failures are P1.

## Step 4 — Consolidate (stable IDs + dedupe)

Merge all lens findings + codex findings + health failures. Assign each a
**deterministic id = short hash of (normalized location + bug_type + short claim)**;
dedupe by id (wording differences don't matter). Severity P1/P2/P3.
- **Keep single-lens P1s** (only drop low-confidence non-P1 with no substantiation).
- **Empirical evidence only strengthens:** a failing test is a confirmed P1. A *passing*
  test does NOT downgrade a reasoning finding — at most annotate "covered by test, lower priority."

## Step 4.5 — Adjudicate (verify each finding yourself; don't trust the lenses)

Lenses and Codex can be over-strict, wrong, or hallucinate. **Before gating, YOU
independently verify each consolidated finding** — never pass them through on trust
(full method: `references/adjudicate.md`).

For each finding (prioritize P1/P2; batch P3): **check it against reality, empirically
when you can** — `Read` the cited code yourself and *prove* it with a cheap probe
(run the regex/function on the claimed input, a 3-line repro, grep the test) rather than
re-reasoning. Weigh corroboration (independent sources, health backing). Judge whether it
is a real defect or **by-design / a nitpick / a known trade-off**, and adjust severity.

Assign each finding a **verdict** with YOUR evidence:
- `confirmed` — you proved it real · `uncertain` — plausible but unproven · `rejected` — false-positive / by-design / unsubstantiated.

Only `confirmed` reaches the gate; `uncertain` is surfaced (flagged) but non-gating;
**`rejected` is listed in a "Filtered" section with reasons — never dropped silently.**
Never state an unverified finding as fact. (`--refute` adds skeptic sub-agents per confirmed P1.)

## Step 5 — Gate + fix

- **Gate (confirmed findings only):** PASS iff `confirmed P1 == 0 AND (confirmed P2 == 0 OR each remaining deferred with a reason)`.
  `uncertain` is surfaced but does not gate; `rejected` never gates. Plan mode may also apply a rubric gate (overall ≥ 7, every dimension > 3).
- **fix=report** (default): print findings + suggested fixes only. No edits.
- **fix=apply:** only **`confirmed`** findings are eligible. Apply **Mechanical** fixes (obvious, high-confidence, empirically backed) automatically;
  **Taste / User-Challenge** decisions go through `AskUserQuestion`. **Never edit a plan doc without explicit user approval.**

## Step 6 — Report + persist

Print a findings table: `id · severity(orig→adjudicated) · location · source(lens/tool) · verdict · claim · evidence · fix · status`,
then the gate result, skipped tools, and a cost summary. Add a **"Filtered (rejected / by-design)"**
section listing every `rejected` finding with your reason — so the filtering is auditable and the
user can override your judgment.

Persist to `$RUN_DIR/`:
- `findings.jsonl` — every finding (incl. `verdict` + adjudication evidence), one JSON object per line (append-only).
- `summary.md` — the human-readable report (table + gate + skipped + cost).
- `cost.json` — lenses run, codex calls, tools, approx tokens/wall-time.

---

## Degrade / edge cases
- Nothing to verify (no path, no diff, no plan) → ask once, else stop cleanly.
- codex / a health tool / an opt-in skill missing → skip that layer, note it in the report (no silent fallback).
- `+security`(`gstack:cso`) / `+stats`(`scientific-skills:...`) etc. invoked via the Skill tool; if the
  invocation fails or is unavailable, **downgrade to a written recommendation** in the report (no hard dependency).
- ≥2 opt-in Layer-3 tools would run → list them + cost estimate and confirm via `AskUserQuestion`.
- `cycles>1` → run the convergence loop in `references/cycles.md` (ledger + carry-over + acks + checkpoint).
